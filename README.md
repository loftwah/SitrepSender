---

---

## Prerequisites

- **Ruby 3.3+**: To run the script.
- **Bundler**: For managing dependencies.
- **Resend Account**: To send emails via their API.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automation (optional).

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loftwah/SitrepSender.git
cd SitrepSender
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=<your_resend_api_key>
SENDER_EMAIL=<your_sender_email>
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=<recipient_email>
REPORT_PERIOD=Weekly
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Prepare Your Content

- Place Markdown or HTML files in the `./reports` directory. These files should contain the specific information you want included in your report. For example:
  - **Daily**: Key metrics, logs, or events from the last 24 hours.
  - **Weekly**: Summaries, highlights, or performance trends for the week.
  - **Fortnightly**: Mid-month updates or milestones.
  - **Monthly**: Comprehensive overviews, project progress, or financial summaries.

**Important**: The script doesnâ€™t validate or modify the content; it simply generates and sends whatever is in the `reports/` directory. Ensure youâ€™ve placed the correct files for the desired period.

### 2. Run the Script

```bash
ruby email_report.rb
```

### 3. Dynamic Subject Line

- The email subject dynamically changes based on the `REPORT_PERIOD`, for example:
  ```
  Loftwah's Daily Sitrep
  Loftwah's Weekly Sitrep
  Loftwah's Fortnightly Update
  Loftwah's Monthly Sitrep
  ```

      - name: Send Sitrep
        env:
          RESEND_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.RESEND_API_KEY }}
          SENDER_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.SENDER_EMAIL }}
          RECIPIENT_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.RECIPIENT_EMAIL }}
        run: |
          case $(date +"%d") in
            01) REPORT_PERIOD=Monthly ruby email_report.rb ;;
            15) REPORT_PERIOD=Fortnightly ruby email_report.rb ;;
            *) REPORT_PERIOD=Daily ruby email_report.rb ;;
          esac

### Explanation

#### **What Is UTC?**

## Customisation

### Dynamic Report Periods

The `REPORT_PERIOD` environment variable controls the report type. Defaults to `Weekly`, but you can set it to `Daily`, `Fortnightly`, `Monthly`, or any custom value. This also updates the email subject and header.

### Style Tweaks

The email design is controlled by inline CSS in the `generate_report` method. Update it to match your style.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Environment Variables Not Loaded**

- Ensure the `.env` file exists and contains valid values.

#### 2. **Resend API Errors**

- Double-check your `RESEND_API_KEY`.
- Ensure sender and recipient emails are valid.

#### 3. **Missing Content**

- Make sure youâ€™ve added Markdown or HTML files to the `./reports` directory.

### Debugging

Run the script with detailed logs:

```bash
DEBUG=true ruby email_report.rb
```
